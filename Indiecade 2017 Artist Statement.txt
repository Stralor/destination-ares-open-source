Destination Ares is ultimately about the fallibility of humanity. Even in our brief blips of peace, we can't help but cause undue hardship on each other. Violence is not always overt. We stratify ourselves into classes, grow in disdain for "the Other", and idly cause small inconveniences that often coalesce and reverberate into greater evils. Our mistakes always have consequences.

As the ship's AI, the player is tasked with one simple imperative: keep the crew alive long enough to get to the red planet.  The AI had no hand in what happened before and has little in what happens after. Yet, this solitary goal has larger consequences: the AI is the only being who will care for these people unconditionally, despite their abuses and failings. Though strife and implicit remains present, this is one brief blip of peace that could change the fate of an entire colony.

The AI may care only as much as it achieves its goal, but the events of the journey inevitably cascade growth in its understanding. Which begs the question: in a game where the player is the AI and the humans are programmed NPCs, what defines real humanity? What defines a real human act?
