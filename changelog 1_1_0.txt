This update is significant in some fundamental parts of the code. It will break any in-progress runs.

[h1]Difficulty Options, for the less masochistic[/h1]
(Note: you still qualify for achievements while using these)
[*] Resource Drain - High (Default), Low
[*] Crew Skill - Untrained (Default), Skilled, Expert
[*] Luck - Even (Default), Improved
[*] Minigame Toggle (hotly demanded!)

[h1]System Construction & Salvage[/h1]
[*] Build makeshift systems when everything goes wrong! (Uses Science skill)
[*] Break down old systems for a few materials and parts! (Uses Mechanical skill)

[h1]New Events - what could go wrong?[/h1]
[*] Free a crewmember from the jaws of the toilet's suction piece
[*] Flood the atmos with vaporized fuel when the air pressure is low
[*] Turn an old corpse into something useful
[*] Use solar arrays as a shield from micrometeoroids
[*] Push a faulty fabricator to consume everything onboard or die trying
[*] Receive a definitely innocent memo from GuideBot

[h1]Fixes, Improvements, and Wildly Incoherent Changes[/h1]
[*] Started up minigame tutorial sooner
[*] Sped up minigame tutorial
[*] Made GuideBot harass you more often with snarky tips
[*] "Broken" tooltip text now red
[*] Overhauled event data structure internally
[*] Updated dev tools
[*] Unlocked all crew personalities from the beginning of the game; I apologize in advance if you roll a Chatty crewmember
[*] Fixed - Crew sometimes abandoned ship secretly when they were supposed to die, were listed as "Survived"
[*] "Pause" now slows the game to 1/500 speed, rather than perfect 0
[*] Added a second way to enter the path to the secret ending
[*] Some hard to press buttons are now, you know, easier to press
[*] Your hidden AI core more consistently consumes energy (every 10 seconds)
[*] Command skill is now more effective at preventing that passive energy drain, with the same diminishing returns
[*] Base crew resilience to stress is lowered, but more consistent
[*] Command skill increases stress resilience for all crew - so long as the crewmember(s) with the skill are capable of doing work
[*] (No changes to bonus minigame time from Command skill)
[*] Crew need to eat slightly more food and sleep slightly longer
[*] Special crew with increased resilience to needs (i.e., the "skilled engineer" and "famous scientist") eat a little less and sleep faster, in addition to less often
[*] The "wealthy doctor" gets a bonus point in Command
[*] Choosing "high quality system retrofits" does more, including handing out keywords
[*] Achievements should no longer unlock early

Known Bugs
[*] Rarely dead crew continue moving for awhile, drifting about the ship and/or swinging arms (definitely won't fix)

IN PROG
I set some breakpoints on trouble achievements, hoping to catch one or two during other testing to get free insight. Also added them on "survived" calls in case I missed one of the crew jumping ship

Testing
