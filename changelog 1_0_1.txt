[h1]Improvements[/h1]
[*] Shortened how long it takes before the minigame tutorial turns on
[*] Slowed minigame tutorial down
[*] Clarified wording in minigame tutorial
[*] Improved clickability of minigame's "Return to Ship" button
[*] Destroyed systems are now more recognizable in their tooltips
[*] Increased how often crew will do off-task work. Should see more idle usage and repairs, especially with jobless crew

[h1]Fixed[/h1]
[*] Fixed some special loss events getting ignored if the player resumes a run after exiting the game
[*] Fixed a couple achievement toggles (incl The Arean Trail. Grats if you got it free), though I suspect there's something else going on here
[*] Fixed typo in one of the Madness possibilities
[*] Fixed a bug in event management that had weird cascading effects
[*] Fixed Loss events getting overridden
[*] Fixed Loss events not spawning
[*] Made some tweaks that hopefully prevent a rare, hard-to-reproduce crash
[*] Fixed some blank crew chatter popping up
