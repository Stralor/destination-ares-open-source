[*] Significantly reduced likelihood that crew dies from sleep deprivation
[*] Added more crew death flavor texts
[*] Fixed a crash from loading while stopped
[*] Fixed refugee endings so they aren't overwritten by the tutorial
[*] Temporarily turned off particles on the bottom controls, until Unity fixes the particle crashes (I'm hoping to redo the buttons soon, anyway)
[*] Simplified space dust speed calculations (hopefully avoiding more such particle crashes)
