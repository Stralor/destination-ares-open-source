R Kim Shultz is the composer for Destination Ares.

He's a lifelong lover of music and passionate in his craft; he spent 15 years as a professional performer before retiring into the corporate world. In 2008, he returned to music as a composer. Since then, he's done extensive work in the film industry, often scoring dramatic horror, and occasionally comedy. This work has been a perfect backdrop for Destination Ares, and his work on the game is likewise fantastic.

Kim is based in Chicago. More about Kim's current work can be found at rkimshultz.com.

Patrick Scott is the director and developer behind Destination Ares. If it wasn't music, he did it. From coding to art, marketing & community outreach to design, business management to writing, he's a man of many hats.

Pat's educational focus was in the sciences, until he pivoted into an English BA in 2011. Realizing his notebooks since childhood were more full of doodles and game concepts than lecture notes, he decided to chase dreams and teach himself to make games. After a couple months with a programming textbook, he popped out a few prototypes, both digital and tabletop. From 2012 to 2014, he and a business partner developed a half dozen mobile apps, four of which saw publication, though none ever became profitable. In 2014, Pat also ran a Kickstarter campaign (unsuccessfully) for a board game he designed.

After going his own way in mid-2014, Pat began work on Destination Ares and has been at it full-time ever since.
