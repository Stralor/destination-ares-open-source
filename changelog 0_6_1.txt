0.6.0a (I originally shadow-released this fix without notes)
[*] Fixed the victory achievements so they don't trigger from the tutorial

0.6.1
[*] Upgraded to Unity 5.6
[*] Fixed crashes from not letting the Steam Manager boot up (shouldn't have affected players)
[*] Fixed crew body parts overlapping inconsistently. Now when crew overlap, it's all or nothing
[*] Changed disabled buttons that say "Inert System" to say "Passive System", to match a terminology change last patch
[*] Increased UI SFX a bit
[*] Added a type header to the event pop up, in addition to the border coloring
[*] Fixed bug where audio wouldn't play occasionally
[*] Added an easier and faster build pipeline. It took a while to set up, but now updates will push out much more easily
[*] Adjusted Food tooltip so it's more clear that a Kitchen is required for the crew to consume — not create — food
[*] Added crew portraits in ship building
[*] Added menu selection responsiveness to crew portraits
[*] Fixed hydroponics system portrait: it has its outline!
[*] Added system keyword: Hardened — +2 Durability when overdriven
[*] Added system keyword: Performant — +2 Output when overdriven
[*] Changed how overdrive works: it stays on when the system takes damage and becomes Strained, and it can be turned on at Strained
[*] Changed ship building so you can only add one keyword to a system. Note: old ship designs retain the second keyword (if you put one)... but you can no longer change it
[*] Added a delay between songs, music should no longer be constant
[*] Fixed the minigame clock beep being a constant tone (whoops!)
[*] Removed current and effective speed numbers when tooltips set to "Simple"
[*] Reduced constant bleating of alarms. "Supposed to be annoying" got too annoying
[*] Reduced the volume of Warning alarms
[*] Changed alarm SFX to diegetic. This also happens to make them all quieter
[*] Fixed error in menu screen that prevented hungry and dead mouths from appearing
[*] Fixed resource icons jumping about on creation
[*] Added wave effect when someone/ something takes damage. Its bigger for more significant things, like dying

One side note: I'm changing my numbering system to simple increments. It means bugfix-only patches won't be as apparent. However, it's easier to manage and keep consistent (each build is either a minor or major increment!).
