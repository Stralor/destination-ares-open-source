[*] Added strained animation when system is both strained and in overdrive
[*] Fixed overdriven systems being enabled and repaired on load
[*] Fixed negative momentum ending the game
[*] Increased animation speed for engines and waste cannons while the injector's effect is active
[*] Added added injection effect to system tooltips when relevant
[*] Changed a bunch of events that required engines to also allow waste cannons
[*] Added a Standard event: "Puketastic"
[*] Fixed minor typo in opening story
[*] Fixed a Story event that was mislabelled as "Unknown"
[*] Changed Gyms into [Passive] systems, seeing as there's no reason to turn them off (for all the cruel AIs out there: you can still use ignore alerts if you want your crew to neither use nor repair gyms)
[*] Changed Toilets into [Passive] systems, for the same reason as Gyms
[*] Increased effect of lost progress on event kindness
[*] Fixed event kindness so it increases as you have fewer resources compared to storage capacity
[*] Added successful events as a reduction on event kindness
[*] Added living crew as a reduction on event kindness
[*] Increased effect of broken systems on event kindness
[*] Fixed VFX from upgrading to Unity 5.6.1p1
[*] Changed Use alerts so they can turn on systems (fewer clicks ftw)
[*] Fixed Overdrive commands so they always turn on systems, if not already on
[*] Overdrive now automatically turns off when system turns off
[*] Rephrased a sentence in the Tutorial (This will probably be moot after I replace the tutorial)
[*] Now recolor system borders when you highlight resources. This should make it faster and easier to see what systems are involved with what resources
[*] Fixed mouse pings so they still always appear on main menu
[*] Added CRT effects to main menu and ship building
[*] Changed menu button colors (because I felt like it)
[*] Fixed an outline-related crash
[*] Fixed a crash from invalid crew heal attempts (and a few other potential causes)
[*] Fixed bug that gave out free Fireball achievement on some failed runs (oops)
[*] Fixed bug that delayed some system audios
[*] Reduced volume of Generator audio
[*] Flipped direction of time loss penalty animation in minigame
[*] Added short animation to end of minigame
[*] Fixed rare bug that prevented the minigame from ending
[*] Added game speed controls to the HUD
