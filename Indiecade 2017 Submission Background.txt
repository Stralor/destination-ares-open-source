Funding for Destination Ares provided by

No one.

Development of Destination Ares, to-date, has cost roughly 700 USD, 7000 hours of unpaid work, and years of good health and missed opportunities. It's been done the long, hard, and invisible way: with sweat, blood, and tears (sometimes all at once!).

Destination Ares is only possible because of a lucky confluence of circumstances: a near-full university scholarship (so, a lack of loan debt); the patience of past lovers; the obstinate willingness to spend most days like an ascetic, without money, transportation, or many common possessions; and, ultimately, the immense contributions of family and friends, in myriad forms, from shelter and food to second-hand items and moral support.

Destination Ares also wouldn't be possible without the pain of the world. From personal pains like failed relationships to global human-caused suffering, it sometimes takes a lot of agony to find worth.

Hopefully this game can live up to the charter it's been given. May it give us a reflection of both the pain and the love we give each other.
