  eventText: 'A skilled engineer!


    *T* didn''t really like it on Terra. There were challenges, but they were always
    someone else''s challenges. Nothing was interesting enough.


    When news that a highly illegal interplanetary ship got assembled from stolen
    and salvaged parts, *T* knew they had to get aboard. And oh what a filthy beauty
    this heap of parts is.


    Ares might be pretty cool, too.'
