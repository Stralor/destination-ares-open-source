  eventText: You took the risk of not getting help breaking the body down into manageable
    chunks. It made sense to avoid further crew trauma. But it didn't pay off, and
    now some piping will need replacing. Luckily, the mass from the corpse offset
    the losses to propulsion from the damage.
