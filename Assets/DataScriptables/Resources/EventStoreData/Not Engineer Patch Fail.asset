  eventText: 'You didn''t anticipate such a dramatic outcome.


    *T* put on an EVA suit. Then, they entered the chamber and sealed the hatch. Once
    sealed in, *T* depressurized the chamber and applied the patch canvas.


    Finally, in a stroke of pure brilliance, they took off their helmet.


    Without repressurizing the room.


    Despite your efforts to rapidly pump air into the room, *T* sustained massive
    injuries, especially to their lungs. Even if they survive, they will get strained
    easily from now on.'
