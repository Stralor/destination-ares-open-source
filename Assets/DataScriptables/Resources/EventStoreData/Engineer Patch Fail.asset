  eventText: '*T* waltzes into the chamber, as much as that is possible in zero gravity.
    They approach the puncture and pull out some patch canvas.


    Instead of immediately patching the hole, though, they decide to play with it.
    Soon, poking it leads to a space large enough for their finger to fit.


    "It pains, but''s so fun!"


    And with those final words, *T* tears the hole open a bit too far. Their body
    follows their arm as they''re ripped into the apathetic void, now only shredded
    pieces.'
