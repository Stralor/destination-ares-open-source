  eventText: 'The Great Expanse is everything.


    Everything that ever was, everything that ever is, and perhaps everything that
    ever will be.


    And yet, nothing. The Cold, the Empty.


    Systems everywhere begin to shut down from wear and tear. The Cold seeps in everywhere,
    freezing up what remains and cutting you off from some processes.


    As you drift into an endless hibernation, your last image is of the crew slowly
    dying, battered and shivering.'
