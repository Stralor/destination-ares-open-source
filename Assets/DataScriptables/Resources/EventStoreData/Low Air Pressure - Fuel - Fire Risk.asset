  eventText: As fuel fumes hiss through the vents, the crew coughs and chokes. In
    their oxygen-deprived confusion, *T* reaches to light a match, mumbling something
    about a "stinky sewage fountain." A small bombardment of bright flashing lights
    and loud beeps distracts them long enough for them to drop the match and forget
    all about what they were doing.
