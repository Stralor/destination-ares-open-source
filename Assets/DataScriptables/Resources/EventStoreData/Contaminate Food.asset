  eventText: 'Some lines get crossed and food ends up routing through the corpse''s
    container. The food now poses a health risk to the crew and must be thrown out.
    The container must also be sanitized.


    It seems prudent to evacuate all the contents to space, corpse included. The crew
    can find out once you get to the planet.'
