  eventText: 'Placed out of sight and smell, the soft flesh of the corpse pits and
    melts away slowly, leaving behind a gooey residue that stays attached to the
    bones. In turn, the bones and other remaining bits break down into a dust that
    seeps into the residue, now proper slime, and detoxifies it.


    You let the
    mass float about a while longer to be sure everything has broken down, then suck
    up what''s left into the waste disposal and recycling pipes.'
