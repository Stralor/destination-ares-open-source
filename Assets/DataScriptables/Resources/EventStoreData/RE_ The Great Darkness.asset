  eventText: 'There''s nothing but the Empty between you and whoever set that trap.
    They''re stuck on a woefully prosperous world, doomed to die where they were born
    after a life in conflict with countless others.


    You''re stuck in a hunk of metal with a bunch of idiots, plummeting toward a vacant
    planet. But it''s a moving hunk of metal.


    Maybe you''ll leave and never stop exploring after you get to Ares.'
