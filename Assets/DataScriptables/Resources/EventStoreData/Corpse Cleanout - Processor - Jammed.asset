  eventText: The *T* greedily accepts the corpse, oblivious to the unwieldy shape
    and size. Before long, the whole thing jams up, with body parts half torn and
    sticking out. It's a distressing sight for anyone who might have seen and requires
    some rapid lurches from the ship to dislodge the bits. Before long, however,
    the deed is done and out comes some fresh materials to keep this journey afloat.
