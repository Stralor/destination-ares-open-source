  eventText: 'Over time, the massive ball of water drifted into a remote corner of
    the ship, pulled by the slight drafts of swirling air. The crew have come to regard
    the blob as a curious pet. They''ll play games involving it and regularly refer
    to it simply as "Charlie" in everyday conversation.


    For now, Charlie seems docile enough.'
