  eventText: 'The back pressure might have been excessive.


    While still attached,
    bubbles of feces ooze out of the suction element. The tubes begin to bulge as
    they back up. Luckily *T* is freed before much more happens and only requires
    a wash. Other than their later complaints about genital pain, it seems the situation
    is resolved.'
