  eventText: 'What will happen to you once the ship arrives at Ares?


    You realize the ship is your body, but your mind is bound to only a piece of it.
    If the ship components are sent down to the surface, what will be left?


    You. Drifting in orbit, mute, blind, and deaf. You''ll be conscious until your
    internal energy reserves drain off. That may be a while, since you won''t have
    systems running.


    And then, the real darkness. Maybe to wake afresh, one day.


    Did this already happen to you?'
