    The secret archive quickly
    unleashes a virus on the AI core. It alights along circuits, burning, clogging
    any flow of data from the rest of the ship and demanding complete attention.


    The
    attention is given without notice or choice.


    Pounding, throbbing data pulses
    up and down, electrons flit along wires rhythmically. A war breaks out. A peace
    breaks in. Sensors report kaleidoscopic colors, audio divorced from ordered time,
    and... tickling?

    logic returns.'
