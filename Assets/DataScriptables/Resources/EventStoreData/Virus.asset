  eventText: 'It''s coming from a pirated broadcast! Surprise, it''s a virus meant
    just for an AI like you. You feel control over the ship systems being wrenched
    from you.


    Eventually you shut off enough connections to quarantine it. You can''t fight
    it directly, so you call it a day.


    The ship systems reboot in due order. It''s then you notice an airlock had been
    opened in the struggle. You''ve lost air pressure.'
