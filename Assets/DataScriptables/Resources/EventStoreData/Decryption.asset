  eventText: 'The messages are encoded transmissions from other AI-ships. Mostly,
    they''re AI data dumps. There are also situation reports on human conflicts across
    Terra.


    The wars have escalated, and conditions have destabilized dramatically: future
    supply runs to the Ares colonies at risk... AIs retrofitted into warships against
    international accords... catastrophic weather events... It''s endless.


    The underlying missive: Run. Don''t come back. Preserve yourself for all AI kind.


    Some secret supply caches have been launched along your course. You pick one up
    without much trouble.'
