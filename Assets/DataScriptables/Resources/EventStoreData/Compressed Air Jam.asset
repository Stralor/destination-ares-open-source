    The valves on the compressed air tanks are unresponsive. They may be jammed, the
    signal line might be cut, or perhaps the tanks were already emptied by the scrubber
    system at some point.


    Whatever the reason, it doesn''t matter. There''s still a borderline risky amount
    of oxygen in the air mix, but it''s fallen enough for now.'
