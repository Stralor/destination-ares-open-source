  eventText: 'The ceremony goes according to plan. Kind words are said, tears are
    shed. Or, rather, tears coagulate into blinding blobs around the crew''s eyes.


    Still, it goes well. Until the airlock jams.


    It only lasts a couple of seconds. The hatch doesn''t open fully, so the body
    gets stuck while the air around it rushes out. First the body wrapping tears off,
    then the body itself tears apart. Body parts and tissue spray out of the ship.


    A few bits and gibs are left behind, floating about in the airlock. The crew seems
    terrorized.'
