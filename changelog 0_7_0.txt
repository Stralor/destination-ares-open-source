?This is a huge patch.

It also breaks saves.

Aaaand, it also increases the game's difficulty by a fair margin. Good luck.

Additions
[*] Crew chat when you click on them
[*] Systems turn on/ off when you click on them
[*] Symbols and sounds when you can't turn systems on and off
[*] Reverse pings
[*] Tooltip for event type
[*] Symbol next to systems to show disabled/ enabled more clearly
[*] HUD warnings when you're at imminent risk
[*] Loneliness stress (constant stress over time, increases as crew die, and if a crewmember is left alone)
[*] Added death by loneliness (and an achievement for it!)
[*] Hermit role: ignores loneliness
[*] Replaced Interpersonal skill with Command. Command (currently) increases time available in minigame and allows occasional ignoring of AI energy costs
[*] Added new crew speeches
[*] Reduced chance of repeating the same speech in short succession

Changes
[*] Now right click is used to toggle the controls bar, instead of left
[*] Current energy capacity is displayed in the resources HUD
[*] Total energy capacity is explained in the tooltip
[*] Revamped controls bar (both looks and functionality)
[*] Reduced in-scene overhead by converting character speeches to data files not bound to the scene
[*] Increased AI base energy burn rate
[*] Reduced movement slowdown near mines in the minigame
[*] Reduced starting time in minigame
[*] Adjusted crew speech to match in-world lingo. It's now barely on this side of understandable, as it should be
[*] Increased rate of system breakdown
[*] Increased injector time per use
[*] Increased distance to Ares by a third
[*] Dead crew are now always beneath living crew
[*] Updated tutorial to match new controls. I will be overhauling the whole tutorial soon, however

Fixes
[*] Broken mouse controls in minigame
[*] Improved resolution of text in minigame
[*] Crew no longer freezes up when they can't get to a destination (psst don't forget doors)
[*] Crew no longer flicker between two different chat topics at once
[*] Events will no longer stack on each other instantly
[*] Crew colliders now move with their bodies when pulling systems to top
[*] Doors on the two default ships have been resaved in the correct position
